# Swedish timeline proposal:
# 
# 1850 - absolute block, 2-state, man with flag, blue/red cap (choose)
# 1858 - absolute block, 2-state, 1-wing (T), lower quadrant, red plate - choose
# 1880 - absolute block, 2-state, 1-wing (T), lower quadrant, red plate - choose, green plate - presignal
# 1890 - absolute block, 2-state, 1/2-wings, lower quadrant
# 1906 - absolute block, 2-state, 1/2-wings, upper quadrant
# 1907 - absolute block, 2-state, 1/2/3-wings, upeer quadrant
# 1910 - absolute block, 2-state, 1/2/3-wings, upper quadrant, presignal with arm
# 1950 - end of semaphores
# 1920 - circuit block, 3-state, 2-light signals
# 1922 - circuit block, 2/3-state, 2-5 light signals
# 1930 - presignal with yellow for sideway
# 1975 - presignal with two green for sideway
# 1980 - in-cab signalling ATC, same signals as circuit block, max speed 250 km/h, balise

# 8: Stop signal, absolute block
# 9: Distant signal, absolute block
# 10: Junction signal, absolute block
# 11: Token block signal
# 12: Combined signal, absolute block
# 13: Permissive signal, absolute block
# 14: Stop signal, time interval
