When two\nfloors were done, an angry\nInstitute director arrived and\ninsisted on having the cream\ncolor; the hapless worker was\nfired immediately to calm the\ndirector down.

<title>Bioethanol Distillery</title>\n<h1>Bioethanol Distillery</h1>\n<p>In the 21st century ethanol fuel is considered as one of the alternatives to oil. Ethanol could be used in mix with gasoline or alone in vehicles with modified engine.
factory_fish_pond_details
<title>Fish Pond Details</title>\n<h1>Fish Ponds</h1>\n<p>Pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being underneath. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.</p>\n<p>In medieval times in Europe, it was typical for many monasteries, castles, etc. (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have fish ponds. These are still common in the East Asia (notably Japan), where koi carp may be kept.</p>\n<p>This pond is now used for breeding fish which can be later caught, transported, and processed to food. Swimming in it is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Pond works as extensive aquaculture based on local photosynthetical production, meaning that fish are not being fed by artificial food.</p>\n<p>Limiting for fish growth here is the available food supply by natural sources, commonly zooplankton feeding on pelagic algae or benthic animals, such as certain crustaceans and mollusks. Tilapia species filter feed directly on phytoplankton, which makes higher production possible. The photosynthetical production can be increased by fertilizing the pond water with artificial fertilizer mixtures, such as potash, phosphorus, nitrogen and micro elements. Because most fishes are carnivorous, they occupy a higher place in the trophic chain and therefore only a tiny fraction of primary photosynthetical production (typically 1%) will be converted into harvestable fish.</p>\n<p>As a result, without additional feeding the fish harvest will not exceed 200 kilograms of fish per hectare per year, equivalent to 1% of the gross photosynthetic production.</p>\n<p>In order to tap all available food sources in the pond, the aquaculturist will choose fish species which occupy different places in the pond ecosystem, e.g., a filter algae feeder such as tilapia, a benthic feeder such as carp or catfish and a zooplankton feeder (various carps) or submerged weeds feeder such as grass carp.</p>

factory_Oelbohrinsel_details
<title>About oil rigs</title><h1>Oil rigs</h1><p>Second half of 20th century brought hunger for oil - consumption doubled every decade. Apart from land resources, sea offered also some oil deposits, although hard to reach.<br><br>Oil rigs are structures built to exploit these resources located in shelf areas (depth 0 to 200 meters). They are HUGE, but no one actually realizes it - most of the building is hidden under water surface. And also expensive to maintain. Columns that hold the platform are usually hollow and they also function as reservoir for oil.</p><p>The biggest oil rig in the world, Statfjord B, was built by Norway. Its weight is roughly 800,000 tonnes and height about 192 m. With tower the height increases by another 80 meters.</p>
factory_Oelfeld_details
<title>About Oilfields</title><h1>Oilfields</h1><p>Oil is a raw material which was used for paints, lubricants and also as a fuel for heating before the turn of 19th/20th century. Then it gained great importance with boom of combustion engine and automobiles.</p><p><br><br>Oil is a liquid consisting of numerous hydrocarbons. It is unclear how exactly the oil deposits came into being, probably it was a process similar to creating coal deposits but with some extra conditions - under high pressure & without oxygen. They are within depth of up to hundreds of meters. Oil is there usually found together with gas under high pressure, what eases pumping it to the surface.<p>
