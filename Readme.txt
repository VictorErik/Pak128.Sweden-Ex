Welcome to the Pak128.Sweden-Ex sources!


INTRODUCTION
Pak128.Sweden-Ex is a graphics set (pak) for Simutrans Experiemental. It requires a Simutrans Experiemental (S.E.) executable in order to play.

!! Do note that the pak is currently under development why many basic features (such as economy or factories) are not in place !!

Also please note that this "half-height" branch is aimed towards the next generation of Simutrans Experimental. It is not compatible with the current released one (Simutrans 112.3 Experiemental 11.35).


HOW TO PAK FILES
Using the "Pak128.Sweden-Ex.bat", you need to put the S.E. "Makeobj.exe" in the same folder as this "Readme.txt" is located. Then just press the "Pak128.Sweden-Ex.bat" and it should pak itself.
Put the newly created folder "Pak128.Sweden-Ex" containing all the .pak-files into you existing S.E. root folder.


COMPATIBILITY
Pak.Sweden-Ex is intended to use with the next generation of Simutrans Experimental, currently the devel-new branch:
https://github.com/jamespetts/simutrans-experimental/tree/devel-new
No testing has been done wheter it runs on the current release of S.E.(Simutrans 112.3 Experiemental 11.35) or on other older releases of S.E. Use at you own risk!

LICENCE
Pak128.Sweden-Ex is released open source under the terms of the Artistic License. Please read licence.txt for details.

TECHNICAL ISSUES
If there are any technical issues (e.g. error messages, crashes) please make a post in "bugs" board of the Simutrans Experiemental Forum - http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?board=53.0 - Please also state which version of the Simutrans executable you are using and which operating system.

If you encounter any bugs by the pak itself (graphical glitches, missing objects etc), please remember that it is in construction state and then make instead a similar post in the Swedish forum, http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?board=22.0

GAMEPLAY NOTES
This pak is currently in "pre alfa" state, meaning its not playable as a game for the moment. Many key features, such as economy, factories, lack of vehicles etc are yet to be added to the pak before it makes sence as a playable game. However, it should compile and the things currently added should work as intended ingame.
Do note however, that any games saved with this pakset, might not be compatible with future releases!



If you have any notes, suggestions for improvements, or if you want to help developing this pakset, feel free to post in the Swedish section of the forum (English language is allowed!)
